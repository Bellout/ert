PURPOSE:
---------------------

  This document shall:
    - Give an overview of the svn codebase.
    - Provide a list of software requirements for building the prototype.
    - Provide a list of software requirements for using the prototype.
    - Provide the reader with directions to relevant documentation for:
        o Building the prototype.
        o Installing the prototype. 
        o Using a compiled version of the prototype.
        o Understanding the design principles and coding standards in order
          to further develop the prototype.



OVERVIEW OF THE CODEBASE:
-------------------------

  The codebase is organized in directories as follows:
    
    Directory:      Description:
    ___________________________________________________________________________
    apps         |  Applications built on top of the libraries. 
    build        |  Scripts and configuration templates for building.
    docs         |  Documentation.
    libanalysis  |  EnKF analysis libary, Fortran 90.
    libecl       |  Library for reading and writing Eclipse files.
    libenkf      |  Main enkf implementation.
    libhash      |  Portable implementations of hashes, linked lists etc.
    libjob_queue |  Library for handling external jobs via LSF, rsh etc.
    libplot      |  Wrapper for the plplot library, facilitates easy plotting.
    librms       |  Library for reading and writing RMS files.
    libsample    |  Library for sampling GRFs with FFT. Optional.
    libsched     |  Library for parsing schedule files and summary data.
    libutil      |  Support library.
    old          |  Outdated code and documentation.
    Scripts      |  Scripts for starting Eclipse etc.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


BUILDING REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------

    - C and Fortran 90 compilers.
    - Python interpreter (optional, but recommended.).
    - BLAS, LAPACK and Plplot libraries (for linking).
    - FFTW library (optional, only required for libsample).


RUNNING REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------

    - BLAS, LAPACK and Plplot libraries.
    - FFTW library (optional, only required for libsample).
    - Eclipse reservoir simulator and reservoir model.
    - Python interpreter (optional, but required if not LSF libraries are used).
    - LSF cluster access (optional, but *strongly* recommended).
