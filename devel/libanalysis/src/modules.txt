Overview
--------
The ERT application has evolved into a quite complex beast. Originally
the actual EnKF algorithm was located very deep down in the code, and
changes to the EnKF algorithm required detailed knowledge about the
enkf_node objects, the datatype for measurements and observations,
serialisation and so on. Quite complex and fragile stuff.

To facilitate easier development and testing of new update schemes the
core EnKF update step has been factored out as analysis modules, which
are called from the enkf_main scope. The update functions in the
module get ordinary matrices as input, and do not need to know
anything about the internals of the ERT application. 

The modules can either be built in, or you can compile your own module
as a shared library and load it runtime. Apart from the initial
loading internal modules and external modules are treated 100%
identically.
