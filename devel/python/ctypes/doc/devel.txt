Summary

The ert Python classes are based on wrapping (some) of the C libraries
which constitute the ERT application. The wrapping is based on the
python ctypes module which does the wrapping dynamically. The python
classes are quite thin, most of the actual code is in C, however a
user of the ert Python should NOT need to know that there is some C
code deep down.


About ctypes

ctypes is a standard Python module. 








The C libraries are to a large extent developed with abstract types
like:

  typedef struct {
     .....
     .....
  } abs_type; 

and "methods" like:

  abs_type * abs_type_alloc( ) { }
  void       abs_type_free( abs_type * at ) {} 
  int        abs_type_get_an_int( const abs_type * at) {}  
  void       abs_type_set_an_int( abs_type * at , int value) {}

it has therefor been relatively easy to map this onto Python classes
and give a pythonic feel to the whole thing.
