INTRODUCTION

	L-BFGS-B is a quasi-Newton method for optimization with simple bounds.
I.e., given a differentiable function f, it seeks a point x such that:

	x = arg min_y f(y) subject to l(i) < y(i) < h(i)

The L-BFGS-B algorithm only needs information about the function value and the 
gradient (no Hessian matrix required) to find a local minima of f. Also, it
requires only O(n) memory, where n = dim(x), and is thus suitable for large 
scale optimization.

LICENSING INFORMATION

	The "main" implemenation of L-BFGS-B is written in Fortran 77 by Zhu and
Nocedal and distributed under a MiT license, and is free for both commerical and
non-commerical use. Scientific publications using the software is expected to 
quote at least one of the references found at:

	http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html

WHAT IS THIS?

	This is simply a package for compiling L-BFGS-B 2.4 into a static
library suitable for use within the StatoilHydro EnKF system. It seems that
Nocedal does not maintain his L-BFGS-B site, so the Fortran 77 code used is:

	http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~liam/lbfgsb/routines.f

The routines from libblas and liblapack in this file has been removed. We link
against the installed versions instead, this should run faster.

USAGE

	Type "make" to create libbfgs.a. Move to a suitable location.
Usage of L-BFGS-B is described in bfgs.f
