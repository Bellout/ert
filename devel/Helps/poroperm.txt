Definition of priors in real field experiments:

This is all a bit unclear........but:

--The Refcase:
The Refcase is defined as a prior model, and
it should be a consistent running Eclipse model
before the EnKF is being set up.

Thus, the Refcase directory should contain all files
required to run a simulation.

--The Random_Prior
A random prior model can be generated as soon as
all the needed EnKf files are generated, e.g.
ECLIPSE_orig.DATA, SCHEDULE_orig.INC, petrostatistics.xls.
etc.

The random prior is generated using the same statistics
as defined in petrostatistics.xls, and is stored in 
an ensemble file "random_prior.uf".  

A simulation of the random prior is submitted under menu 3b,
and results are stored in the Random_Prior directory.

It is then possible to use the random prior simulation
to simulate the production data in a twin experiment.
