#This file is an example of a path_config file. Because every user can
#have the various libraries required to build EnKF in different
#locations, the path_config file is not under version control.
#
#You should make your own personal copy of this file, and it should set
#correct values for the variables listed below. The final variable,
#EXTERNAL_LIB_PATH is a path where (links to) external librarires like
#blas and particular compiler libraries+++ can be found.
