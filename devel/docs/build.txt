Veeery basic build instructions:

1. Check out a pristine copy of the source code with svn, read the
   section "Initial Checkout" in "svn_help.txt".

2. The EnKF code is based on many different libraries, which are
   interlinked. The makefiles are based on variables like LIBECL_HOME
   and LIBUTIL_HOME which indicate where in the filesystem the libecl
   and libutil librarires can be found, respectively.

   You have to enter this information. To do this go to directory
   build/ and copy the file global_config.template to a file called
   global_config. Edit this file, by setting the correct path for all
   the variables.

   When you have updated the global_config file this must be made
   available from all the libraries, run the script make_tags.py. This
   script will create TAGS files for each directory, and most
   importantly in this context, create a symlink to the global_config
   file.

3. Now you can invoke make in the build directory, this should build
   all the libraries in the correct order.

4. After the intial all-over make, you can of course build the
   libraries individually and independently.
