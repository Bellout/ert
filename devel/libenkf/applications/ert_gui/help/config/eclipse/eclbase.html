<html>The basename used for the ECLIPSE simulations. The name should contain a %d-specifier, which will be replazed by the realization number when running ECLIPSE. 

Example: <b>BASE_%04d</b> will be replaced by <b>BASE_0007</b> for realization number 7. 

Note that due to limitations in ECLIPSE, the basename <b>must</b> be in strictly upper or lower case. </html>
