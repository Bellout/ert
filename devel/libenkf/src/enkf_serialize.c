/**
   This file handles serialization and deserialization of the
   enkf_nodes. This is at the very core of the EnKF update
   algorithm. The final update step is written:

       A' = XA

   i.e. it is linear algeabra, and we need(?) to write the various
   objects in the form of an ensemble matrix, this is the process we
   call serialization. Then the linear algebra update is performed,
   and afterwards we must read the data back from the serial vector to
   the enkf_node object, this is deserialization.

This figure shows the following:

 1. Three different nodes called PORO, RELPERM and FAULT
    respectively. The PORO node consists of eleven elements (P0
    ... P10), whereas the RELPERM and FAULT nodes contain six and
    seven elements.

 2. The ensemble consists of two members (i.e. there is PORO-1 and
    PORO-2.).

 3. The members have been serialized into a a large vector where
    everything comes ordered. Observe that *NOT* all elements from the
    members have been inserted into the large vector, i.e. for the
    PORO fields we only have elements P0 .. P4; this is because (for
    some reason) not all elements were active.


Each of the enkf_node functions have their own xxx_serialize and
xxx_deserialize functions, however these functions SHOULD call the
enkf_serialize() and enkf_deserialize() functions in this
file. (Rolling your own serialize / deserialize functions at the
lowest level is a SERIOUS CRIME.)

The illustration above shows three different enkf_node objects which
have been COMPLETELY serialized. One of the reasons the code is so
complex is that it is supposed to handle situations where the serial
vector is to small to hold everything, and repeated calls to serialize
& deserialize must be performed to complete the thing.
