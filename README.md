The ert repository has been split in two independent repositories, and
the development on the ert git repository has been discontinued.

  https://github.com/Statoil/libecl : Project with main focus on
     reading and writing of ECLIPSE binary files.

  https://github.com/Statoil/libres : Project with libraries and the
      main ERT application.
