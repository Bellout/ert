1. ERT

ERT - Ensemble based Reservoir Tool is a tool for managing en ensemble
of reservoir models. The initial motivation for creating ERT was a as
tool to do assisted history matching with Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF). Very briefly use of EnKF can be summarized as:

   1. Sample initial reservoir parameters from a (Gaussian) prior
      distribution.

   2. Simulate the ensemble of of reservoir forward in time through
      part of the historical period.

   3. Load the results, compare with observed data, update the
      parameters and the state of reservoir and restart the
      simulations.

This recipe is quite complex technically, and in particular involves
the ability to read and write input and output files from the
reservoir simulator (i.e. ECLIPSE in the case of ERT), run simulations
with arbitrary external programs, plotting data and so on. This
implies that a quite significant technical machinery must be in place
before the EnKF algorithm as such can be utilizied. This in particular
applies to real industry reservoir models, where typically
imperfections of all kinds flourish.

The initial motivation for creating ERT was to be able to use the EnKF
algorithm for history matching. Currently ERT is more used with the
Ensemble Smoother and also purely as a worklfow manager; herding a
large collection of reservoir models through the required simulations
steps.
